# Architectural Website  
This project is an architectural website designed to showcase architectural projects and blueprints. The website features a dynamic **Home Page**, a **Portfolio Page** displaying completed projects, a **Blueprint Section** for users to view and download project blueprints, and a **Signup/Login System** for user authentication. Built with **React** for the frontend, it ensures a smooth and responsive user experience. The backend is powered by **Node.js** and **MongoDB**, providing robust data management and API functionality. This project seamlessly combines aesthetics and functionality, making it a valuable platform for architects and users to interact with architectural designs.
